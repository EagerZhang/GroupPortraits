# GroupPortraits
A hyper image project I made at the beginning of pandemic under a photography class assignment "group portrait with your classmates", while everybody was actually quarantined at home.

Hugely inspired by the interactive Web program created by Sophia Schomberg and Nikolaus Baumgarten for the project Zoomquilt and Akadia.xyz.
